Adds a global hotkey (Backspace by default) to open the last viewed/dismissed letter.

For example, you might get a raid. You either open and glance at the letter quickly or you just right-click dismiss it. But then you wonder, "Wait...are they attacking immediately??" You could go into the message history and check it, but with this mod you can just press Backspace to open it up easily.
